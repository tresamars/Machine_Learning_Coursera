# Machine_Learning_Coursera

My answers to the programming assignments from the coursera course Machine Learning offered by Stanford University.
The course can be found here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

Topics covered include:
- Linear regression
- Multiple linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Means Clustering 
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

All exercises were completed in Matlab.
I might still get the certificate in the future.
